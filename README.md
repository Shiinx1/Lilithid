# Lilithid

Hi there!

Lilithid (Cheems) is a Discord Bot, created for the purpose of the game Realm of The Mad God, it helps community server owners, handle entirely their server.
From the verification of people's in-game names to Discord, via selfmade APIs and verification codes, to the entire handling of AFK checks, which allow players to specify their classes, abilities, and what they could bring to the dungeon run.
The bot creates an embed with reactions for users to try to make it in the run, before the countdown and under the player limit.

The Raid Leader, which leads the runs in the community server, can create on their side, these AFK checks and have a control panel to manage them.
This bot also handles suspensions, mutes and warns, like a normal moderation bot would do, but also being in phase with the community server's purpose; being able to restrict users from joining these raids if they don't follow guidelines.
It also helps the Raid Leader accept player's keys to run the dungeon, and allow specific people, who help the server with Nitro, or Patreon, to get the location of the dungeon early, or to make sure they have a spot in the run.

This bot used to run under Fungal and Crystal Cavern Discord community server, who had 33.200 members at the time it used to run.
